Hereâ€™s a concise step-by-step guide covering everything we did for the **Sales Data Pipeline** project:

## **Sales Data Pipeline: End-to-End Process**  

### **Step 1: Set Up PostgreSQL Database**  
- Installed and configured PostgreSQL and pgAdmin 4.  
- Created a new database **`sales_db`** in PostgreSQL.  
- Created a table **`sales_data`** with appropriate schema.  
- Imported the sales data CSV into the PostgreSQL table.  

### **Step 2: Connect PostgreSQL with Python**  
- Installed required libraries to connect PostgreSQL with Python.  
- Established a database connection using **db_url**.  
- Loaded sales data from PostgreSQL into a Pandas DataFrame.  

### **Step 3: Data Cleaning & Processing**  
- Handled missing values and ensured data consistency.  
- Standardized column names to match table schema.  
- Converted data types (e.g., dates, numeric fields).  

### **Step 4: Data Analysis & Transformations**  
- Performed exploratory data analysis (EDA).  
- Aggregated sales by **year, month, product line, and country**.  
- Calculated **total sales, average price per order, and sales trends**.  

### **Step 5: Data Visualization in Power BI**  
- Connected Power BI to PostgreSQL database.  
- Created visualizations:  
  - Sales trends over time.  
  - Sales by country, product line, and customer segment.  
  - KPI cards for **Total Sales, Avg Sales per Order, and Sales Growth %**.  
- Added slicers & filters for interactive analysis.  

### **Step 6: Automating Data Refresh in Power BI**  
- Configured **DirectQuery** mode for real-time data updates.  
- Set up scheduled refresh (Power BI Service).  

### **Step 7: Version Control with Git & GitHub**  
- Initialized Git in the project directory.  
- Configured GitHub repository and committed the project files.  
- Resolved push errors and successfully uploaded the project to GitHub.  

### **Step 8: Extending the Project (Optional Enhancements)**  
- **Automate with Apache Airflow** (for scheduling ETL workflows).  
- **Move to Google BigQuery** (for cloud scalability).  
- **Enhance dashboard with DAX queries** in Power BI.
